More descriptive function for Strings
x = "... o! mr. wee IS cool"

print(x.count("e")) # returns how many (first parameter) has occurred in the string

print(x.replace(" ", "d")) # replaces every (first parameter) to (second parameter)

print(x.capitalize()) # Same as .title(), except only the first letter gets capitalized

print(x.find("o")) # finds the first occuring string (first parameter)

print(x.rfind("o")) # finds the last occuring string (first parameter) (opposite of .find())

print(x.title()) # capitalize every first word, and make all other words lowercased

print(x.upper()) # All letters are uppercased

print(x.lower()) # All letters are lowercased

print(x.isdigit()) # returns if this string is only digit (cannot contain any letters, whitespace, or special characters)

Extra functions:

print(len(x)) # returns the length of the string

print(x.endswith(“cool”)) # returns if the string ends with (first parameter)

print (x.strip()) # returns an string that has removed leading and trailing whitespace.

print(x.split(“ “) # returns a substring depending on the (first parameter)

print(x.join(“ very much!”) # joins the string with (first parameter) this is the same as print(x + “very much!”)

print(x.format()) # format every variable like {variable} to a string this is the same as print(f”string {variable}”)

print(x.startswith(“.”)) # returns if the string starts with (first parameter)

print(x.isalnum()) # same as x.isdigit()

print(x.isalpha()) # returns if the string is only letters (cannot contain any numerical digit, whitespace, or special characters)
