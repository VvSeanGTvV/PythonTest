Note (some optimizing to think about Python)!
Each print might contain the letter -> f !
The f is meant to format variables in a string! yes, you could also technically do this:
print(“Yes, “ + str(num1) + “ cannot be divided by ” + str(num2) + “ .”
But it is kind of slightly unoptimized.
The str() converts the existing object to a string.

If (variable) in [array]: this method allows to check multiple objects in one go without relying on for loop or a very long boolean:

If (variable1 == variable1 or variable2 == variable2… etc):
Or
Ans = [“t”, “true”, “f”, “false”, etc…]
For i in range(5):
	If (usr == Ans[i]):
		return True
return False



“Divisible”

# Prompt the user to enter their name
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Ask the user for the first integer
num1 = int(input(f"Hello, {name}! Please enter the first integer: "))

# Ask the user for the second integer
num2 = int(input(f"Now, {name}, please enter the second integer: "))

# Check if the first number is divisible by the second number
if num1 % num2 == 0:
    print(f"Yes, {num1} cannot be divided by {num2}.")
else:
    print(f"No, {num1} cannot be divided by {num2}.")



“Geometry”
import random
import math

# Prompt the user for a small decimal number
small_decimal = float(input("Enter a small decimal number (lower bound): "))

# Prompt the user for a large decimal number
large_decimal = float(input("Enter a large decimal number (upper bound): "))

# Generate a random decimal number between the small and large decimal values
random_radius = random.uniform(small_decimal, large_decimal)

# Calculate the volume of a sphere using the formula V = (4/3) * pi * r^3
volume = (4/3) * math.pi * random_radius**3

# Output the radius and the volume
print(f"The randomly generated radius is: {random_radius:.4f}")
print(f"The volume of the sphere with that radius is: {volume:.4f}")



“Quiz”
answer = input("Is Python Easy? True or False: ")

# Check the user's response
if answer in ['true', 'True', 'T', 't']:
    print("Correct! Python is easy!")
elif answer in ['false', 'False', 'F', 'f']:
    print("Incorrect. Python is easy.")
else:
    print("Invalid answer. Please enter True, False, T, t, F, or f.")
